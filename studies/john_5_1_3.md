**Section I –**

**The Place of Waiting: The Pool of Bethesda**

**John 5:1–3**

“After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.”

**The Setting: A Feast in Jerusalem**

The story opens with Jesus going up to Jerusalem during one of the Jewish feasts. Now, we’re not told which feast it is—Passover, Pentecost, Tabernacles—we don’t know. But what we _do_ know is that the city would’ve been packed. Religious energy is high. Crowds are flowing. Rituals are being performed. Sacrifices are being made. And in the middle of all that festivity—there’s a _pool_. Not a celebration. Not a crowd dancing with palm branches. But a hidden scene of suffering.

While the city is busy with religion and tradition, tucked away by the sheep gate is a house of pain. That’s the contrast—**while others are feasting, these are waiting**.

**Bethesda: The House of Mercy**

The pool was called _Bethesda_, which means “House of Mercy.” Beautiful name, isn’t it? It _should_ be a place of healing. A place of help. A place where mercy flows and people get restored.

But instead, it’s filled with hurting people—“a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered.”

So we’ve got a “House of Mercy” where mercy doesn’t seem to be flowing. Sound familiar? Sometimes the place that was supposed to heal us becomes the place where we’ve been stuck for _years._

**Can I talk to somebody real tonight?**

Sometimes the church can become Bethesda. It’s called a place of mercy. We know the name. We know the songs. But it can also become a porch full of people just waiting. Waiting for the right revival. Waiting for the right preacher. Waiting for a move. Waiting for something external to stir the water.

But while they’re waiting… they’re withering.

**The Five Porches: A Picture of Stagnant Suffering**

There were **five porches** around the pool. Think about that—a complete structure. Covered areas where people could sit and lie and wait. Five is the number of grace, but here we find grace misunderstood and misapplied. People have come to associate God’s grace with **waiting**, instead of _walking._

Let’s break down who was lying there:

- **Impotent** – those without strength. Powerless.
- **Blind** – those who could not see the way out.
- **Halt** – those crippled in movement. No progress.
- **Withered** – those whose limbs or life had shriveled. Dried up hope.

This wasn’t a healing line. It was a _waiting room._ These weren’t patients being treated—they were prisoners of delay. And just like today, sometimes God’s people get comfortable in the waiting. We sit on porches of “almost.” We get used to “maybe next time.” We build community with others who are also stuck.

They weren’t just waiting for healing. They were **surviving the wait**.

Imagine it. These porches weren’t just there for decoration. They were shelters—structures _built_ around the broken. Places designed to protect the weak, the weary, the wounded. And that’s fine for a season. It’s okay to have a space where healing can happen. A place to catch your breath. But these porches became more than temporary coverings. They became _permanent fixtures_.

They weren’t just resting there… they were _living there_.

These porches had become **comfortable places for uncomfortable conditions**. Can I preach it like I feel it?

Some of us have been living on spiritual porches for years. We built routines around our dysfunction. We put up fences around our bitterness. We laid down rugs on the floors of our disappointment. We said, “I guess this is just the way it is.”

And now, instead of getting up, we’ve gotten used to the view from the porch. Instead of seeking deliverance, we’ve learned to decorate our dysfunction. We’re not fighting the condition anymore—we’ve made _peace with it_.

We’ve spiritualized our stagnation. We’ve justified our weakness. We’ve settled in with phrases like:

- “This is just my thorn.”
- “God must be teaching me something.”
- “I’ve always struggled with this.”
- “Nobody’s perfect.”

But what if God never called you to stay on that porch?

What if that structure you’re leaning on is actually the very thing keeping you from standing?

What if we’ve created systems and surroundings that **support** our stuckness instead of challenge us to move?

**Let’s Make It Real**

- **The Porch of Past Hurt** – “I got hurt before, so I don’t serve anymore.” You built a porch around your pain.
- **The Porch of Shame** – “I messed up too bad to be used again.” You built a porch around your failure.
- **The Porch of Comparison** – “They always get picked, not me.” You built a porch around your insecurity.
- **The Porch of Tradition** – “This is how we’ve always done it.” You built a porch around your fear of change.

These aren’t just excuses. They’ve become _structures_.

And here’s the danger… **the longer you stay on the porch, the more you start believing it’s your permanent address**.

But Jesus didn’t come to decorate your porch. He came to tear it down and say, _“Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.”_

**Preaching Conclusion for This Thought**

You were never meant to build porches around your paralysis.

You were never called to structure your life around your struggle.

God never asked you to pitch a tent on the edge of your breakthrough!

**Tear down the porch.**

**Break up the boards.**

**It’s time to walk!**

**Section II –**

**Troubled Water and Timid Hope**

**John 5:4**

“For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.”

**Textual Note**

Let’s go ahead and deal with the elephant in the porch. Verse 4 is one of those scriptures that doesn’t appear in some of the earliest Greek manuscripts, and most modern translations put it in brackets or footnotes. But we’re sticking with the **King James Version**, and we’re going to teach it **like it’s there for a reason**—because it _is_.

Whether this was something God did at one point or whether it was a tradition the people believed in—**it represents the system the man trusted in**.

And that’s the key right there. Because this system was unpredictable, limited, and unfair. It was a “maybe.” It was a “sometimes.” It was a “once-in-a-while, if-you’re-fast-enough” kind of hope.

**The System of Stirring**

- The belief was that _an angel would come down at a certain season_—not always, not every day—just _at a season_.
- And when the angel stirred the water, **only the first one in got healed.**
- Can you imagine the scene? Sick people watching the surface of the water like it’s a lottery ticket.
- And when that water moved, **it wasn’t peaceful. It was troubled.**

The very thing they hoped in was **unstable**, **competitive**, and **limited to one person at a time**. It wasn’t grace. It was a _race_.

“Whoever stepped in first…”

It was healing by hustle. Breakthrough by beating others to the punch. It was _faith in the stirring_, not faith in the Savior.

**Lesson: When We Rely on Unstable Systems Instead of the Unchanging Savior**

This pool represents more than just water. It represents **false systems of hope** that people still cling to today:

- “If I can just get this promotion…”
- “If I can just meet the right person…”
- “If I can just get into the right church, with the right crowd, at the right time…”

But here’s the problem: we’re watching the water when the Word is walking right toward us.

**The Living Water has come to the stagnant pool.**

**Mercy is no longer seasonal—it’s walking in sandals and asking questions.**

**The Man’s Timid Hope**

This man had been in that condition **thirty-eight years**. Just imagine how many times he saw that water move and couldn’t get in. Hope deferred makes the heart sick (Proverbs 13:12). He was worn out. Broken down. Maybe even numb. He’s still here, but there’s no real expectation anymore. Just a shadow of hope.

He didn’t come to the pool looking for Jesus. He came looking for _the stirring_.

And how many people today come to church, to altars, to livestreams—not really looking for Jesus, but looking for a _feeling_… a _goosebump_… a _stirring_.

They don’t want **change**—they want **a moment.**

They don’t want to be made **whole**—they just want to be _soothed_ for a while.

**“The Old System Says: One Person, One Time, One Chance… But Jesus Says, ‘Whosoever Will!’”**

The old system at Bethesda was exclusive. It was limited. It was high risk, low reward. It said:

- **One person** – Only the fastest. Only the strongest. Only the one who had help.
- **One time** – You miss it, you’re done. Wait for the next season.
- **One chance** – If someone beats you in, that was your shot. Try again next year—maybe.

It was _scarcity thinking_ in a _survival system_. That’s how the world works, and sadly, how religion can work when it forgets mercy.

It’s the idea that there’s only enough healing for a few. Only enough room at the altar for the desperate. Only enough blessing for those who’ve earned it. It’s that _“first come, first served”_ kind of faith.

But then… here comes Jesus.

And He doesn’t walk up and say, “Wait your turn.”

He doesn’t say, “You’ve been here long enough, maybe I’ll choose you.”

He doesn’t say, “Let’s wait for the next stirring.”

**He walks up to the lowest, the weakest, the one who never made it in time… and He speaks life.**

“And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come.

And let him that is athirst come. And **whosoever will**, let him take the water of life freely.”

— Revelation 22:17

Come on now. That’s not just a new system. That’s **a new covenant**.

That’s not healing for the worthy. That’s healing for the _willing_.

That’s not breakthrough for the qualified. That’s breakthrough for the _thirsty_.

Jesus didn’t come to extend the old rules. He came to rewrite them with mercy, baptize them in grace, and open the door wide enough for **you**, **me**, and every broken soul still lying by the pool.

**Transition to Section III:**

The pool was still. The porches were full. And hope was faint. But that’s when Jesus walks in. He didn’t come through the temple. He came to the broken, the forgotten, the overlooked. He didn’t go to the ones shouting in the feast—He walked up to the one man who had been in this condition for **thirty and eight years.**

And He doesn’t start with healing. He starts with a question that cuts deep.

**Section III –**

**A Question That Cuts Deep: “Wilt Thou Be Made Whole?”**

**John 5:5–6**

“And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?”

**A Certain Man**

He wasn’t the only one there. The text says there was a “_great multitude_” of people—impotent, blind, halt, withered. But Jesus walks past the crowd and locks in on _one man_. A certain man.

We don’t even know his name. No pedigree. No position. No prayer request card. Just pain and time.

He had been in that condition **thirty and eight years**.

That’s longer than Jesus had even been on earth in flesh. That’s a lifetime for some people.

And yet, the scripture says **Jesus saw him**, and knew **he had been now a long time in that case.**

Oh, thank God that even when nobody else knows how long you’ve been struggling, **Jesus knows.**

When the crowd stops caring, and your condition becomes your identity, Jesus still sees you as **a certain man**, not a statistic.

**The Question: “Wilt Thou Be Made Whole?”**

Jesus doesn’t walk up and say, “What happened to you?”

He doesn’t say, “How long have you been here?”

He doesn’t say, “Who hurt you?”

He says, **“Wilt thou be made whole?”**

Not: “Do you need healing?”

Not: “Do you believe in miracles?”

Not: “Do you want me to help you get in the pool?”

No. He goes straight for the soul and says:

**Do you want to be whole?**

**Let’s Break That Question Down:**

- **“Wilt”** – That’s about _willpower_, _desire_, _decision_. This isn’t passive. It’s personal.
- **“Thou”** – Not the crowd. Not your neighbor. Not your mama. _You._
- **“Be made whole”** – Not just healed. Not just relieved. But _whole_. Complete. Restored. Put back together inside and out.

**What’s Jesus Really Asking?**

Jesus is confronting **a comfort that’s grown in his condition**.

He’s asking, “Do you even _want_ to be different? Or have you gotten used to this mat? Used to this identity? Used to this porch?”

Sometimes, the longer you stay in something, the more it becomes who you are.

- You stop being “the man who had a setback” and become “the crippled man.”
- You stop seeing yourself as someone in a hard season and start seeing yourself as _stuck forever_.
- You stop reaching for healing and start collecting excuses.

So Jesus walks in and shatters the victimhood with one simple, soul-cutting question:

**“Do you want to be whole, or do you just want to stay here and blame the system?”**

hat’s the tension of this whole moment right here. Jesus is standing in front of this man with healing in His mouth, power in His presence, and restoration in His reach—but the man’s hands are already full… full of **reasons**, **regrets**, and **rationalizations**.

“I have no man…

Someone always steps ahead of me…

I’ve been here a long time…”

He’s not answering the question. He’s explaining the condition.

And here’s the tragedy: **You can miss your miracle while explaining your misery.**

Some folks have gotten so used to rehearsing _why_ they’re stuck, they never even reach for what would get them _out_.

Jesus asked for a decision—“Wilt thou be made whole?”

But the man gave a _defense_ of why it hadn’t happened yet.

**Let Go to Lay Hold**

See, healing requires _both hands_. You gotta **let go of the excuse** to **grab hold of the Word**.

You can’t:

- Clutch that victim mentality _and_ grab onto victory
- Cling to “why it’s not fair” _and_ step into favor
- Hold your hurt like a trophy _and_ take hold of truth like a sword

**Excuses will always talk you out of obedience.**

They’ll tell you, “It’s not time.”

They’ll whisper, “You’re not ready.”

They’ll scream, “It’s too late!”

And all the while, Jesus is saying, “_Rise. Take up thy bed. Walk._”

But you can’t _rise_ when you’re still holding on to the weight of _why_.

“What if Jesus walked up to _you_ right now and said, ‘Wilt thou be made whole?’ Would you say yes? Or would you start telling Him why it hasn’t happened yet?”

Because the truth is—some people have been sick so long they’re afraid of what life looks like if they actually _get up_.

- Afraid to leave the addiction.
- Afraid to walk away from the bitterness.
- Afraid to step out of the identity they’ve built on dysfunction.

But Jesus didn’t come to comfort you in your condition. He came to _confront it_ with truth and grace. He came to ask the question nobody else has the guts to ask you—**do you want to be whole, or are you just used to being broken?**

**Section IV –**

**The Excuse and the Blame**

**John 5:7**

“The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.”

**The Response That Misses the Point**

Jesus asked a _yes or no_ question:

“Wilt thou be made whole?”

And the man replies with,

“I have no man…”

He doesn’t say yes.

He doesn’t say no.

He gives **an excuse**, **a story**, **a reason** why it hasn’t happened.

And let’s be real—his answer _sounds_ logical. It even sounds pitiful. But it reveals something deep:

**He’s been looking for a man instead of looking for a Messiah.**

**No Man to Help**

“I have no man…”

That phrase right there still rings in the hearts of so many people.

- “I have no one to support me.”
- “I have no one who believes in me.”
- “I have no pastor to mentor me.”
- “I have no family backing me.”
- “I have no spouse, no money, no platform.”

It’s the universal language of **delay by disappointment**. He’s saying, “I could’ve been healed… but someone failed me.”

It’s always _somebody else’s fault._

But here’s the gospel truth:

**God will never let the absence of man override the presence of God.**

Jesus didn’t walk up and say, “Let’s find you a helper.”

He didn’t say, “Let’s get you a better system.”

He said, “Let’s deal with this _now._”

Because _when God speaks a word_, every man-made delay becomes irrelevant.

**The Trap of Horizontal Faith**

This man’s entire focus was horizontal.

His eyes were on the crowd. His expectation was tied to the movements of others.

- “If I had someone…”
- “If they didn’t beat me to it…”
- “If the timing had been right…”

But **he never even looks up** to realize that **the Living Word** is standing right in front of him.

Some of us are so busy watching the people around us that we miss the _presence that’s come to confront us_.

We’re watching church folks, comparing blessings, scanning social media, taking attendance, scrolling for hope…

…while Jesus is standing right in front of us asking, _“Do you want to be whole, or are you going to keep telling Me why it hasn’t happened?”_

That man at the pool had been disappointed for a long time. Thirty-eight years is a long wait. And somewhere along the way, he started measuring his miracle by _who did or didn’t show up for him_. He said:

“I have no man…”

In other words, “If someone had just helped me… I wouldn’t still be like this.”

**Let’s pause right there.** That’s where so many of us get stuck—not in the sickness, but in the **absence of support**.

- “If my dad had been there…”
- “If my pastor hadn’t overlooked me…”
- “If my spouse would’ve stayed…”
- “If my leader had believed in me…”
- “If they hadn’t left me in the middle of my mess…”

But Jesus didn’t walk up to this man and say, _“Who let you down?”_

He didn’t say, _“Where’s your crew?”_

He didn’t say, _“Let’s process your abandonment trauma for a few years.”_

He said, **“Rise.”**

Because the God who shows up will always be more powerful than the people who didn’t.

**What This Line Really Exposes**

- We often delay our own deliverance waiting on people who were never assigned to our healing in the first place.
- We place our faith in the _hands_ of men when God is trying to draw our attention to the _voice_ of the Master.
- We let _relational disappointment_ turn into _spiritual paralysis._

But here’s the word:

**You don’t need them to show up in order to stand up.**

You don’t need their apology.

You don’t need their support.

You don’t need their validation.

**You’ve got a Word. And that’s enough.**

**Section V –**

**Three Commands: Rise, Take Up Thy Bed, and Walk**

**John 5:8–9**

“Jesus saith unto him, _Rise, take up thy bed, and walk._

And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.”

**Jesus Doesn’t Respond to the Excuse—He Responds with a Command**

Jesus doesn’t validate the man’s pain. He doesn’t argue with the story. He doesn’t address the absent helpers. He goes straight to the soul and releases a **command that carries power**:

“_Rise, take up thy bed, and walk._”

No stirring. No ceremony. No water.

Just a Word.

Because when Jesus speaks a command, it _carries within it the power to obey._

**Let’s Break Down the Three Commands:**

**1.**

**Rise**

&nbsp;**–**

**Stand up from where you’ve been stuck.**

This is the first call: **change your posture**.

He’s been lying down so long that the floor has become familiar. He’s used to looking up at other people walking past. He’s lived low, stayed low, thought low.

But Jesus says: _Get up from the ground you’ve identified with._

That place of limitation, that porch of paralysis—it’s no longer your home.

**You don’t belong on the mat anymore.**

Healing begins the moment you obey the command to change your posture.

**2.**

**Take Up Thy Bed**

&nbsp;**–**

**Carry what used to carry you.**

That bed represents **his old identity**.

- It was where he lay in weakness.
- It was the symbol of his limitation.
- It was the thing people saw and said, “That’s the man who lies there.”

But Jesus says, “Take it up.” Don’t leave it behind. Don’t hide it. Don’t pretend it didn’t happen. **Pick it up. Carry it. Let that bed be your testimony.**

What used to define your dysfunction is now going to preach your deliverance.

Don’t let shame cover what grace has healed.

Don’t be embarrassed about what God brought you through. **Carry it. Talk about it. Let the bed preach.**

**3.**

**Walk**

&nbsp;**–**

**Move forward and don’t return.**

Now that you’ve risen, and now that you’re carrying your testimony—it’s time to walk.

Not wobble. Not crawl. **Walk.**

- Walk like you believe you’re healed.
- Walk like this ain’t temporary.
- Walk like you’ve been made whole.

He had never done it before. There was no practice. No physical therapy. No warm-up.

But when Jesus says “walk,” the body responds—even if the mind still remembers the mat.

**Faith doesn’t need all the details. It just needs the direction.**

**Immediate Obedience**

The Bible says:

“_And immediately the man was made whole…_”

Not eventually. Not gradually. Immediately.

Why? Because **obedience activates the miracle.**

He didn’t say, “I don’t feel strong yet.”

He didn’t say, “Can I try in a few minutes?”

He didn’t test the water. He obeyed the Word.

**“Some of You Are One Act of Obedience Away from Immediately!”**

That man had no idea that this was _the moment_. No warning. No angel. No water stirring. Just **a Word**. And all that stood between him and _wholeness_ was **one act of obedience**.

Not a prayer.

Not a worship song.

Not a fast.

Not a church service.

Just **one step in the direction of the Word.**

He didn’t even say “Yes, Lord.”

He didn’t speak in tongues.

He didn’t fall out.

He didn’t shout.

He **moved**.

“And **immediately** the man was made whole…”

That means the healing didn’t come _before_ the obedience. It came _as he obeyed._

It didn’t come _when he believed hard enough._ It came when he _acted on the Word._

**📖 Bible Echoes That Back This Up:**

- **Naaman** didn’t get healed until he dipped the _seventh_ time (2 Kings 5:14). One more dip.
- **The lepers** in Luke 17 weren’t healed _before_ they left. The Bible says,

“_And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed._” (Luke 17:14)

- **The widow of Zarephath** didn’t get her miracle until she made the cake _first_ for the prophet (1 Kings 17:13–16).
- **Peter** didn’t walk on water until he _stepped out of the boat_ (Matthew 14:29).

**One act of obedience unlocked it.**

We’ve all done this. We’ve all said, “I would obey, but…”

- But my past
- But my pain
- But my church hurt
- But my family
- But my lack of experience
- But my fear
- But what if I fail?

And all the while, the Lord is saying:

“I didn’t ask for your résumé. I asked for your _yes._”

Excuses don’t move heaven. **Faith does.**

**Section VI –**

**The Sabbath Confrontation: When Religion Can’t Rejoice**

**John 5:10–13**

“The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?

And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.”

**They Saw the Bed, Not the Miracle**

This man had been lying on that mat for thirty-eight years.

The community knew him. They walked past him. He was part of the landscape. But now—he’s _walking_, _carrying_, _moving_, _healed_. This should be a **moment of praise**.

But what do they say?

“It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.”

What?!

Not “Praise God!”

Not “You’re walking!”

Not “How did this happen?!”

**Their first response is correction—not celebration.**

**Legalism Over Liberty**

They were more concerned about **the rules being broken** than **the man being made whole**.

- They were bound to **ritual** while ignoring the **reality** of what had just happened.
- They were obsessed with **compliance**, not **compassion**.
- They were trained to guard the _day_, but blind to the _deliverance_.

Let’s say it plain:

**Religion can become so rule-focused, it loses sight of the Redeemer.**

**The Man’s Defense**

“He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.”

He didn’t even know who Jesus was yet. He just knew one thing:

**The man who healed me told me to carry this bed—so I’m carrying it.**

He didn’t have all the theology. He didn’t know Jesus’ name. He hadn’t been trained. He hadn’t been baptized. He hadn’t joined a church. But he obeyed the **voice that healed him**.

That’s powerful right there.

Because sometimes **obedience to the Word comes before full revelation of the One who spoke it.**

**Let’s Talk to the Saints for a Second**

We’ve got to be careful, Church. Sometimes we look at people walking into our buildings with their beds still in hand—_tattoos_, _track marks_, _baggage_, _bitter history_—and instead of rejoicing that they’re walking, we start pointing at the bed.

“They don’t dress right.”

“They shouldn’t be leading.”

“They need to sit down for a while.”

“Why are they shouting like that?”

And while we’re policing the porch, **Jesus is passing out healing.**

**“If Your Doctrine Can’t Celebrate Deliverance, Then It’s Time to Bring Your Doctrine Back to the Altar!”**

Doctrine matters. We know that.

Sound doctrine is essential. It defines who Jesus is. It guards the gospel. It keeps the Church rooted in truth. But here’s the danger: **when your doctrine becomes so rigid that it can’t rejoice with the redeemed… it’s no longer sound—it’s sour.**

That’s what we see right here in John 5. A man has just been _healed after 38 years_ of paralysis. He is **walking**—something only God could do.

But the religious leaders didn’t say:

- “Bless the Lord!”
- “That’s amazing!”
- “Let’s glorify God!”

No, they said:

“It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.”

What?! Your doctrine made you blind to the **move of God** right in front of you?

If your doctrine causes you to rebuke revival,

If your doctrine causes you to muzzle miracles,

If your doctrine makes you more focused on a rule than a **rescue**…

Then **your doctrine needs an altar call.**

**What This Line Reveals**

- Some people have elevated **tradition above transformation**.
- They’ve built a theology that is more about control than compassion.
- They’ve traded the **living fire of Pentecost** for the cold form of religion.
- They use the Word to build fences, not to open doors.

But if your doctrine doesn’t know what to do when someone gets up off their mat and starts walking with boldness, then it’s not Apostolic—it’s _apathetic_.

Your doctrine should never silence your shout.

Yes, we believe in standards. Yes, we believe in order. Yes, we believe in truth. But **truth without mercy becomes a sword that wounds instead of heals**. And if your doctrine leaves no room for dancing after deliverance… it needs to be **brought back to the altar and laid down before the One who is Truth.**

**Section VII –**

**Go and Sin No More: The Call to Holiness After Healing**

**John 5:14–15**

“Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, _Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee._

The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.”

**“Afterward Jesus Findeth Him…”**

This is one of the most beautiful verses in the chapter—_Jesus found him again._

He didn’t forget him.

He didn’t heal him and move on.

He didn’t say, “My job’s done.”

He found him.

Let that sink in. The same Jesus who finds you in your pain will **find you in your progress**. He doesn’t just walk into your brokenness—He walks into your **becoming.**

And where did Jesus find him?

“In the temple.”

The man who had been lying outside the system is now **inside the sanctuary**. Healing had brought him into the house of worship. That’s what real deliverance does—it doesn’t just bring relief, it brings **relationship**. He’s not on the porch anymore. He’s in the presence.

**“Behold, Thou Art Made Whole: Sin No More”**

Now Jesus gets real. He says:

“You’re not just walking… you’re _whole._ But now that you’re whole, I’ve got one command: **Sin no more.**”

Wait… what? Was sin connected to his condition?

We can’t say every sickness is tied to sin, but in this case—it seems clear. Jesus says,

“_Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee._”

In other words:

“You’ve been set free. Don’t go back to what broke you.”

**The Call to Holiness**

Healing is not a license to do whatever you want.

It’s a **call to live different.** It’s not just about walking better, it’s about **living holy**.

Jesus doesn’t just deliver us from **mat-level living**—He delivers us from the **sin that got us stuck there** in the first place.

This is where a lot of folks stop short. They want **wholeness** without **holiness**.

But Jesus doesn’t separate the two.

**Wholeness without holiness will only last until the next worse thing.**

**“Lest a Worse Thing Come Unto Thee”**

That line right there ought to make us tremble.

There _is_ a worse thing than being lame.

There _is_ a worse thing than being bound to a bed.

And that’s living healed on earth… but lost for eternity.

Jesus came back to make sure the man didn’t just get his legs back… but got his **life** back.

**“Some of Y’all Want Deliverance Without Discipline, Power Without Purity, Wholeness Without Repentance—But Jesus Says, ‘Sin No More.’”**

Most folks want the healing _without the holiness_.

The freedom _without the follow-up_.

They want the miracle, but not the **mandate**.

Let’s be real:

- We love shouting over deliverance.
- We love dancing about power.
- We love testifying about breakthrough.

But we get quiet when Jesus starts talking about **sin**.

Because here’s the truth nobody shouts about:

**Deliverance without discipline will lead you right back into bondage.**

**Power without purity will corrupt your character.**

**Wholeness without repentance won’t last—it will rot.**

**Everyone Wants Out—But Not Everyone Wants to**

**Stay**

&nbsp;**Out**

Jesus didn’t say, “Be careful.”

He didn’t say, “Try your best.”

He didn’t say, “Just come to church.”

He said:

**“Sin. No. More.”**

That’s a _line in the sand_ kind of word. That’s Jesus saying,

“I didn’t raise you just to _walk_—I raised you to _walk right._”

**Let’s Drive It Home**

- “You cried out for a miracle, but are you ready for the mandate that follows?”
- “You asked God to pull you out—but are you willing to shut the door behind you?”
- “You’ve been made whole, now _live like it._”
- “Freedom isn’t real if you keep going back to the chain.”

**Application**


If Jesus has healed you…

If He’s raised you…

If He’s forgiven you, filled you, restored you…

Then it’s time to **put away the sin that kept you on the mat.**

Not just because it’s wrong. Not just because it’s dangerous. But because:

**He didn’t bring you this far just for you to turn around and go back.**

If you go back now, it won’t just be familiar—it’ll be _worse_.

**You can’t walk in freedom and flirt with what broke you.**

**You can’t walk in power and still play in the pit.**

**You can’t shout about grace and then crawl back to guilt.**

**_“Sin no more.”_**

Not because you’re scared of hell—but because you’ve _tasted heaven_.

Because you know what it feels like to walk.

Because you know the voice that raised you.

Because He’s worthy.

**He found you once to raise you up.**

**He’s found you again to call you higher.**

Don’t waste your healing.

Don’t lose your walk by going back to sin.

Don’t trade your wholeness for a feeling.

Don’t lay back down where grace stood you up.

**Rise. Take up your bed. Walk. And sin no more.**
